Welcome to the gwnum library.

-> how to use
	Before calling gwinit and one of the gwsetup routines, the
	global variables defined in cpuid.h must be initialized.  You can
	do this yourself or let gwinit do it for you (it will call the
	guessCpuType and guessCpuSpeed routines).

	Next, study gwnum.h and tutorial.txt for a list of functions and how
	to best use them.

-> how to compile / how to port

Windows:
	To make the libraries, your path must already be set to the proper
	C compiler (32-bit or 64-bit).  Then execute
		nmake /f compile
	to build the 32-bit libraries and 
		nmake /f compil64
	to build the 64-bit libraries and
		make -f makemw64
	to build the MinGW-w64 64-bit libraries.

Linux 32-bit:
	The assembly code object files have already been converted to ELF format using
	Agner Fog's objconv on a Windows machine.

	"make -f makefile is used to compile the necessary C and C++ source files on the
	Linux machine and to finish building the gwnum.a library.

	A C application using gwnum must link with:
		gwnum.a gwnum.ld -lpthread -lstdc++

Linux 64-bit:
	The assembly code object files have already been converted to ELF format using
	Agner Fog's objconv on a Windows machine.

	"make -f make64" is used to compile the necessary C and C++ source files on the
	Linux machine and to finish building the gwnum.a library.

	A C application using gwnum must link with:
		gwnum.a gwnum.ld -lpthread -lstdc++

FreeBSD 32-bit:
	The assembly code object files have already been converted to ELF format using
	Agner Fog's objconv on a Windows machine.

	"make -f makebsd" is used to compile the necessary C and C++ source files
	and to finish building the gwnum.a library

	A C application must link with:
		-lcompat gwnum.a gwnum.ld -lpthread -lstdc++

FreeBSD 64-bit:
	The assembly code object files have already been converted to ELF format using
	Agner Fog's objconv on a Windows machine.

	"make -f makebsd64" is used to compile the necessary C and C++ source files
	and to finish building the gwnum.a library

	A C application must link with:
		-lcompat gwnum.a gwnum.ld -lpthread -lstdc++

Mac OS X (Intel CPUs only):
	The Mac OS X build procedure is different than linux (because universal
	binaries require both the 32-bit and 64-bit libraries).  The assembly code object
	files have already been converted to Mach-O format using Agner Fog's
	objconv on a Windows machine.  To finish building the libraries, run
	"make -f makemac".  The resulting libraries will be in release/gwnum.a,
	debug/gwnum.a, amd64/release/gwnum.a, amd64/debug/gwnum.a.

	A C application must link with gwnum.a -lpthread -lstdc++
	You may also need to add multutil.o to the linker command line.
	For reasons unknown, the linker has trouble pulling it out of gwnum.a

Haiku (probably no longer works):
	The assembly code object files have already been converted to ELF format using
	Agner Fog's objconv on a Windows machine.

	"make -f makehaiku" is used to compile the necessary C and C++ source files on the
	Haiku machine to finish building the gwnum.a library.

	A C application using gwnum must link with:
		gwnum.a gwnum.ld and either -lstdc++.r4 (for GCC2) or -lstdc++ (for GCC4)
