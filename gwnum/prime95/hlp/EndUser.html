<h2>Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search Research Computing Software v24</h2>
<br>
It is up to you to <b><font size="2">get your employer's permission</font></b> before 
installing this software on any office machines. Many companies have a strict policy 
against running any non-business software, however hundreds of companies and other 
large organizations are participating successfully in the GIMPS research project. 
Your network administrator, MIS or IT manager is welcome to contact us about this 
software at <A href="mailto:primenet@mersenne.org">primenet@mersenne.org</a>.&nbsp; 
You can also ask for help or more information at
<a href="http://www.mersenneforum.org" target="_blank">http://www.mersenneforum.org</a>.<br>
<br>
Every effort has been made to ensure that you will be assigned an exponent that 
no one else has tested or is testing. We are not responsible for lost prize money, 
fame, credit, etc. should someone accidentally or maliciously test the number you 
are working on and find it to be prime. We are not responsible should the program 
determine a number composite even though it is prime - the program's heavy use of 
memory and FPU could trigger an error that goes undetected. <br>
<br>
Finally, as with all freeware, the program is provided "as is". However, please 
do send bug reports and suggestions for improvements to
<A href="mailto:woltman@alum.mit.edu">woltman@alum.mit.edu</a>. See
