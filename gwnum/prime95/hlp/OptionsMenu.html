<!--/EXPAND-->&nbsp;<h2><a name="Cpu">Cpu</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/CpuDlg.png" width="354" height="281"></p>
<p><b>The CPU</b> menu choice lets you tell the program how often the program will 
run and how much memory the program can use. The dialog box also displays your CPU 
type, speed, and capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Preference">Preference</a></h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/PreferencesDlg.png" width="366" height="238"></p>
<p><b>The Preferences</b> menu choice lets you control how often a line is written 
to the main window and how often a line is written to the results file. It also 
lets you change how often intermediate files (to guard against power failure and 
crashes) are created. You can control how often the program checks to see if you 
are connected to the Internet. The program polls whenever it has new data to send 
to or work to get from the PrimeNet server. If you are low on disk space, you can 
select one intermediate file instead of two. However, if you crash in the middle 
of writing the one intermediate file, you may have to restart an exponent from scratch. 
You can also tell the program to be quiet, rather than beeping like crazy, if a 
new Mersenne prime is found. You can also make prime95 go idle whenever your laptop 
is running on battery power (does not work under Windows NT/2000/XP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Torture Test">Torture Test</a></h2>
<b>The Torture Test</b> choice will run a continuous self-test. This is great for 
testing machines for hardware problems.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Benchmark">Benchmark</a></h2>
<p><b>The Benchmark</b> choice times the program on several FFT lengths. You can 
then compare your computer&#39;s speed to others list at
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/bench.htm">http://www.mersenne.org/bench.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Tray Icon">Tray Icon</a></h2>
<b>The Tray Icon</b> choice will cause prime95 to have a small icon on the taskbar 
when it is minimized. You can activate or hide the program by double-clicking on 
the small icon. If you place the cursor over the small icon, a tool tip will display 
the current status.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="No Icon">No Icon</a></h2>
<b>The No Icon</b> choice is only enabled if the Advanced Menu is activated with 
the password. Using this menu choice means there will be no prime95 icon on the 
taskbar once you minimize the program - making it very hard to reactivate! You can 
reactivate the program by trying to execute prime95 a second time. Alternatively, 
you can turn this feature off by editing prime.ini and change the line &quot;HideIcon=1&quot; 
to &quot;HideIcon=0&quot;, then reboot.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Start at Bootup">Start at Bootup</a></h2>
Checking the <b>Start at Bootup</b> menu choice will run prime95 as a service that 
is started when your computer boots up. Windows NT/2000/XP users need administrator 
privileges to use this feature. This method of starting prime95 is better than creating 
a shortcut to prime95 in the startup folder. That is because services run even when 
no one is logged on. These are the details you should be aware of:<br>
<br>
In Windows 95/98/Me:<br>
<br>
The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices registry 
entry is created. You will not be able to tell any difference between prime95 running 
as a service and prime95 running as an ordinary process.<br>
<br>
In Windows NT/2000/XP (without administrator privileges):<br>
<br>
In this case the menu text is changed to &quot;Start at Logon&quot;. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
is created. Prime95 will run only when you are logged in.<br>
<br>
In Windows NT/2000/XP (with administrator privileges):<br>
<br>
There are a few minor quirks when running as a service. You shouldn&#39;t run into these 
quirks in normal operation. You can only change this option once and it will take 
effect when the service is started or stopped. You will need to exit prime95 running 
as a normal process before starting the prime95 service. Finally, the prime95 window 
will only appear on one users desktop. Only one prime95.exe program can be run as 
a service. If you have a dual processor system you&#39;ll want to run two instances 
of prime95. Instead of running a second prime95 from another directory, run the 
second prime95 from the same directory with the -A1 switch (go to a DOS window and 
type “prime95 –A1”). Finally, if you are worried about giving users access to a 
GUI service running in the Local System account, you can turn off the &quot;Allow service 
to interact with desktop&quot; option in the services control panel applet or run the 
GUI-less NT service version available at
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm">http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm</a>. 
These options are more secure than using the No Icon menu choice<br>
